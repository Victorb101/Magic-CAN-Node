It's based on the Texas Instruments C2000 Piccolo, a 32-bit microcontroller with useful features. 

Some important features of the Magic CAN Node include:
* 15 analog inputs
* Two onboard pushbuttons and two general-purpose LEDs
* Access to SPI, I2C, and serial interfaces, as well as power and ADC pins, through standard "backpack" header
* Power loss detection; small backup capacitor to execute critical code when power is lost
* CAN interface, including automatic CAN termination
* Powered from +12V
